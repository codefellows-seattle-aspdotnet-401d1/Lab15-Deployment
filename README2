This labe took about 4 hours to complete.  I started from full scratch and didn't re-use any components from the previous labs. 
I did reference previous labs as well as the demo videos from yester and demo code.  I used Brandon as a resourse too, for the Azure
SQL migration.  I learned about the challenges of deploying a database to azure server and connecting it to my app.
