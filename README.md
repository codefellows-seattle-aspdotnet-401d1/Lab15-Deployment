=====================================
- This took me 4 hours.
- I struggled with connecting to my SQL database in Azure. The code review helped a lot.
- I learned how use layouts/partials and how to connect to my Azure database through the connection string in appsettings.json.
- I utilized the class demo, my previous labs, and the Microsoft docs.
